- Maybe we should've forfeited.
- Come on now. It's just a bit of rain.

11
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,323
Yo, Coach Harris, do you
think we could pull over?

12
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:33,324
I gotta take a piss.

13
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,535
No way. You should've
done that before we left.

14
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,078
Come on, man. I did!

15
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,872
- Yeah? What was that for?
- Practice.

16
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:42,292
Practice makes
perfect. Ain't that right, V?

17
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,294
Bro, according to your
average on penalty kicks,

18
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,421
you should work on your
aim every chance you get.

19
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,430
- Oh shit!
- Chip!

20
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,225
Vero!

21
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,786
As Hurricane Abby
gains strength off the coast,

22
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,872
Miami will be seeing strong
wind and rain advisories today.

23
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,665
So stay tuned and stay inside.

24
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,878
- Where is he, Luis?
- Don't you have surgery?

25
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,731
- Come on!
- He's in his office.

26
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,840
- What happened?
- He doesn't want any visitors.

27
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,176
- You talking about Phillips?
- Why are you so wet?

28
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,512
- Biked. Same as always.
- You're a grown man.

29
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,765
I am. And smart enough to know
that leased Beamer's a money pit.

30
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,517
The pit has a soft-top. I'm dry.

31
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,935
What,
are you moving in?

32
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,229
There's a hurricane. It's
called being prepared.

33
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,276
- Danny, you have to get up.
- I am.

34
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,655
- You're lying down.
- And I am preparing to get up.

35
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,073
Come on.

36
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,700
Don't make the day worse
by being late to shift.

37
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,954
- So they know?
- Uh, not the details.

38
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,290
Was
he…? After the…?

39
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,310
- Yeah.
- Was he what? After the what?

40
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,174
Will someone tell me what
the hell is going on?

41
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,089
Yesterday, Phillips got
reported for sexual harassment.

42
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,006
What?

43
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,135
Then he crawled into a fifth of
tequila. Or maybe it was two.

44
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,139
He was in bad shape.
I've never seen him like this.

45
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,975
Did something happen
at the, uh, retreat?

46
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,495
I don't know, man. It's not like
they put that shit in a memo.

47
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,689
This is bullshit. The guy's a saint.
The junior residents love him.

48
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:31,192
He's the best chief resident we ever
had. This doesn't make any sense.

49
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,819
I mean, does Danny
know about this?

50
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,780
Wait, who reported him?

51
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,448
They knew it was me?

52
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,371
Hey, come on. Sit down.

53
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,462
Come on.

54
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,303
- What's the storm doing?
- Getting bigger.

55
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,513
- Coming towards us?
- Yeah, looks like it.

56
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,098
Great.

57
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,182
Hey.

58
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,978
Remember when we were kids? You
used to sneak us into concerts.

59
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,980
What would you say
about the mosh pit?

60
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,067
Whatever you do,
don't fall down.
