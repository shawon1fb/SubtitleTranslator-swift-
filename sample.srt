- Maybe we should've forfeited.
- Come on now. It's just a bit of rain.

11
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,323
Yo, Coach Harris, do you
think we could pull over?

12
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:33,324
I gotta take a piss.

13
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,535
No way. You should've
done that before we left.

14
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,078
Come on, man. I did!

15
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,872
- Yeah? What was that for?
- Practice.

16
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:42,292
Practice makes
perfect. Ain't that right, V?

17
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,294
Bro, according to your
average on penalty kicks,

18
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,421
you should work on your
aim every chance you get.

19
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,430
- Oh shit!
- Chip!

20
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,225
Vero!

21
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,786
As Hurricane Abby
gains strength off the coast,

22
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,872
Miami will be seeing strong
wind and rain advisories today.

23
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,665
So stay tuned and stay inside.

24
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,878
- Where is he, Luis?
- Don't you have surgery?

25
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,731
- Come on!
- He's in his office.

26
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,840
- What happened?
- He doesn't want any visitors.

27
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,176
- You talking about Phillips?
- Why are you so wet?

28
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,512
- Biked. Same as always.
- You're a grown man.

29
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,765
I am. And smart enough to know
that leased Beamer's a money pit.

30
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,517
The pit has a soft-top. I'm dry.

31
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,935
What,
are you moving in?

32
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,229
There's a hurricane. It's
called being prepared.

33
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,276
- Danny, you have to get up.
- I am.

34
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,655
- You're lying down.
- And I am preparing to get up.

35
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,073
Come on.

36
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,700
Don't make the day worse
by being late to shift.

37
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,954
- So they know?
- Uh, not the details.

38
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,290
Was
he…? After the…?

39
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,310
- Yeah.
- Was he what? After the what?

40
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,174
Will someone tell me what
the hell is going on?

41
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,089
Yesterday, Phillips got
reported for sexual harassment.

42
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,006
What?

43
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,135
Then he crawled into a fifth of
tequila. Or maybe it was two.

44
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,139
He was in bad shape.
I've never seen him like this.

45
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,975
Did something happen
at the, uh, retreat?

46
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,495
I don't know, man. It's not like
they put that shit in a memo.

47
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,689
This is bullshit. The guy's a saint.
The junior residents love him.

48
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:31,192
He's the best chief resident we ever
had. This doesn't make any sense.

49
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,819
I mean, does Danny
know about this?

50
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,780
Wait, who reported him?

51
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,448
They knew it was me?

52
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,371
Hey, come on. Sit down.

53
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,462
Come on.

54
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,303
- What's the storm doing?
- Getting bigger.

55
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,513
- Coming towards us?
- Yeah, looks like it.

56
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,098
Great.

57
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,182
Hey.

58
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,978
Remember when we were kids? You
used to sneak us into concerts.

59
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,980
What would you say
about the mosh pit?

60
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,067
Whatever you do,
don't fall down.

61
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,904

00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,895
It's her story to tell.
And I support her.

70
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:52,232
'Cause if Phillips gets fired, you're
next in line for chief resident.

Anyone's gonna get fired,
I'd love for it to be you.

00:03:57,278 --> 00:04:00,490
Chan. What do you think about
this whole Phillips thing?

73
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,244
I was on all night. I don't got the
energy to represent all women today.

00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,497
Oh… And what about our
lovely new student here?

75
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,750
Oh. Camila Perez. Third
year med student, UM.

76
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,294
Don't bother. Cole can
hardly remember my name,

77
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,755
and I've worked with him for
two years. Unfortunately.

78
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:18,341
Good morning, Harriet. Hermione?

79
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,426
Harper Simms.
Second-year EM resident.

80
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,761
Bus crash on their way in.

81
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,304
Mm. Where's your sister?

82
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,266
What? Don't want her to sneak up
while you're talking shit about her?

83
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,350
Too late.

84
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,319
What? You think I'm gonna read a
prepared statement or something?

85
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,612
Three minutes out!

86
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:45,868
Um…

87
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,290
You okay?

88
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,582
Fantastic.

89
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,751
Why? Something happen?

90
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,712
- That's not funny.
- Cole, back off.

91
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,505
We gonna pretend
everything's normal?

92
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:59,316
- No one's doing that.
- Danny is doing that.

93
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,884
- Cole.
- Look, I told HR the truth.

94
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,304
It's over. Whether anyone
here supports me or not.

95
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,987
It's a bit hard to support you
when we have no idea what happened.

96
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,142
Is that why it's hard?

97
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,271
Well, I think it was brave.

98
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,355
Thanks.

99
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,023
Whoever you are.

100
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,776
Okay. Everyone, listen up.
I'm gonna make this quick

101
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,529
because we have a bus of patients
that need our full attention.

102
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:25,867
Chief Resident Phillips has been suspended
pending an internal investigation.

103
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,832
This means we'll need to appoint
a replacement on an interim basis.

104
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,125
You got your speech ready?

105
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,669
And with the full
support of the faculty…

106
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,629
I have chosen Danny Simms.

107
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,423
Shit.

108
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,051
Whoo.

109
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,557
So let's give her the same
respect we always afforded Dr. Phillips,

110
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,934
and let's get through
this day. Okay?

111
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:00,276
I would like you to meet your new
Chief Resident, Dr. Xander Phillips.

112
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,780
- Just transferred in from Kennedy.
- Hey guys, nice to meet you.

113
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,657
Kennedy, huh? Why transfer?

114
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,242
Better fleeces, obviously.

115
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,079
You like this, don't you? Yeah. Okay.

116
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:14,624
No, look, I do know this is
unusual, so I will be honest.

117
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,794
Kennedy's been good to me, but McGuire
was my first choice for residency.

118
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,005
Probably for the same reason
as it was for all of you guys.

119
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,382
'Cause Dr. Cruz.

120
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,510
She built this place into the best
Level I Trauma Center in the state.

121
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,720
Thank you. But you've
already got the job.

122
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,847
It's them you need to convince now.

123
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,766
That's
easy, Dr. Cruz.

124
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,310
What do you think about the
pastelitos at Versailles?

125
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,940
Huh? Huh? Huh?

126
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,984
Take your time.

127
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,783
I've had better.

128
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,791
We're
gonna get along.

129
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,297
Dr. Cruz.

130
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:06,008
- Dr. Cruz, you can't.
- Can't what?

131
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,177
- You can't promote me. Not now.
- Why not?

132
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,221
Because it doesn't look good.

133
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,098
Well, this
is where we are.

134
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,937
You didn't want it
to be me, did you?

135
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,315
I'm sure you'll prove
to us why it should be.

136
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,362
Less than a minute!

137
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,623
Congratulations.

138
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,791
Thanks.

139
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,796
- What have you got?
- Cyclist on the causeway.

140
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,799
Got caught in a multiple car
crash. We lost pulses en route.

141
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,259
- Where's surgery?
- I got it.

142
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,261
Uh, trauma one.

143
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,180
If he gets pulses
back and needs the OR,

144
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,848
turf him quick
'cause I need you.

145
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:57,268
Seventeen-year-old male with obvious
head trauma, blown left pupil.

146
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,829
- Harper.
- I got him.

147
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:02,064
Gabe, call neurosurgery. Let me
get ahead to set up for an airway.

148
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,066
Chip Harris, bus
driver and team coach.

149
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,195
Got a chest full of windshield and
water. Hypotensive. GCS of ten.

150
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,988
He's critical. Get
him to trauma two.

151
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,990
I got it. Stay on triage.

152
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,878
Oh, Dr. Simms, right?
You know this guy?

153
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,379
Santino Cuesta,
he was my patient.

154
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,590
Came in with a dog bite
yesterday. He was fine.

155
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,634
He's not anymore. Family
found him unconscious.

156
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:30,717
His pressure's tanking.

157
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,480
- Give me an 8.0 ET tube, please.
- The bite was superficial.

158
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,890
We cleaned it, updated his
tetanus, gave him antibiotics…

159
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,186
All right, suction, please.
I can see the cords.

160
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,938
He was still tachy on discharge.

161
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,649
It's not the bite. It's the dog.

162
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,193
He needs a FAST exam. I bet
he's got a ruptured spleen.

163
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:50,363
It's in. Bag him. I need a
portable chest X-ray and an EKG.

164
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,157
- Did you say ruptured spleen?
- His abdomen's distended.

165
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,994
The dog, they have this huge bullmastiff.
He said it knocked him down a few times.

166
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,664
It must have been the impact,
not the bite. I…

167
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:00,623
I missed it.

168
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,458
It's possible, but
that is a big leap.

169
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,670
- It'll kill him if you don't move fast.
- Hey. Take a breath.

170
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,839
You just got here and you wanna
tell me what to do with my patient?

171
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,216
You take a breath, dude.

172
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:13,928
Sorry.

173
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,888
Name
four kinds of nuts.

174
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,766
- What?
- Four kinds of nuts or get out.

175
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,185
Um…

176
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,311
Pistachio,

177
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,106
walnut, almond, peanut.

178
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:28,109
- Peanut is a legume, but close enough.
- Give me the ultrasound.

179
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,485
You think I'm right?

180
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,281
Let's find out. Now that you've picked
yourself out of the ceiling fan,

181
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,242
I have a feeling you might
be a pretty good doctor.

182
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,621
- What've we got?
- 17-year-old male from the crash.

183
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,416
- Stable vitals with an amputated hand.
- Trauma one. This way.

184
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,418
Monitoring,
140, it's good.

185
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,218
Ready? One, two, three.

186
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,681
- Okay. Where's the hand?
- Rescuers are still searching.

187
00:09:58,764 --> 00:09:59,682
You're new.

188
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,184
- Started a few weeks ago.
- Wasn't a question.

189
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,478
This dressing looks like
it was done at Chipotle.

190
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,397
- Excuse me?
- What's your name, kid?

191
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,566
Okay, loud and clear.

192
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,944
Let's get him a 75 fentanyl for the
pain and call ortho and vascular.

193
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,696
I do want to know
your name, though.

194
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,032
Okay? And here's
why. Look at me.

195
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,659
I need to know your name
because I'm responsible for you.

196
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:22,163
I'm going to bother people about
you. I'm going to worry about you.

197
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,916
I want to know who I'm worrying
about. Okay, how about this?

198
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,835
You just nod when
I get to it, right?

199
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,838
You look like you
could be a Josh.

200
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,715
Kevin…

201
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,299
Marie?

202
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:36,844
Tyler.

203
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,096
Tyler Marie. Beautiful.

204
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,181
Okay.

205
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,808
- My hand.
- Hey. Hey.

206
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,061
- My hand, man.
- Hey. They're looking for it.

207
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,605
And I'm not gonna let them
stop. I promise. Okay.

208
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:52,568
- What are you waiting for, Chan?
- Uh, yeah. What do you need?

209
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,154
What do I need? You don't
wait for me to tell you.

210
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,656
You tell me what I need. Right?

211
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,825
I can help stabilize the
arm so you can unwrap him?

212
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,953
There we go. The new girl came
to work today. Get in here.

213
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,622
Chan, you can go back to sleep.

214
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,087
Vero. Is she here?

215
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,130
Vero?

216
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:17,468
Ugh… My friend. Vero. She was
sitting next to me. Is she here?

217
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,680
I don't know, mate. We can find
out, but what was her last name?

218
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,015
Vero Cruz. Vero Cruz.

219
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,352
We've got to find her.
The water was so black.

220
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,770
Uh, did you say Vero Cruz?

221
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,939
Okay, tell Danny.

222
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:30,940
Hey, hey, hey.

223
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,859
Tyler, I'm on it, okay?
We'll find her, okay?

224
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,827
Good morning,
Natalie. How are you?

225
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,450
Good, and how are you, Ruben?

226
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,411
You know, hanging out.

227
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,499
Is that the cyclist
from the bridge?

228
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:49,583
Yes.

229
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,171
Ruben.

230
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,381
Just say it.

231
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,425
Okay, look…

232
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,176
A hurricane is coming.

233
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,928
Right now it's raining.

234
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,263
And when it makes landfall?

235
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:05,516
We'll lock it down and ride it out.
That's what this place was built for.

236
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,768
Days like this, I bet you wish

237
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:12,064
the ER wasn't run by
the surgery department.

238
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,234
It's hard to let go of something
I built from nothing, but…

239
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,197
That is not
what you're getting at.

240
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,236
Okay. All right.

241
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,407
Listen, on the harassment thing,
I have no opinion, all right?

242
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,575
Nor is it your concern.

243
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:25,703
Fine. But maybe not the best day to
have a sudden change in leadership.

244
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,204
Natalie, please.

245
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,082
Phillips,
he's a rock down there.

246
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,834
He was the one
everyone looked to.

247
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,711
Danny Simms is a capable doctor.

248
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,839
She's so capable,
she can lead a short-staffed ER

249
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:40,176
in the city's only Level I Trauma Center,
and all of that through a hurricane?

250
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:47,850
I am trying to avoid a legal and PR
shitstorm that we will be hit with

251
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,896
if we are not mindful about our
response to a complaint like hers.

252
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:55,149
Especially one involving
Xander Phillips.

253
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,779
It's a lot of
confidence you're putting in Simms.

254
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:00,696
Yes, it is.

255
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,240
And I hope you have the
same confidence in me.

256
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm Dr. Simms. I
hear you need some stitches.

257
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,961
Yeah, that's me.
They just numbed it, actually.

258
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,087
Y'all are lucky.

259
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,882
Dr. Simms gives some
world-class stitches.

260
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,762
All right, my man. I
think you're gonna live.

261
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,430
Let's see about that
glass. Shall we?

262
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,099
- Am I gonna have a scar?
- Do you want a scar?

263
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,352
I mean, girls like scars, right?

264
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,562
I like guys who read books.

265
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,941
- Hey, you doing okay?
- Me?

266
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,527
- Why?
- Oh, come on.

267
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,987
It can't feel good to lose
out on that promotion.

268
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,864
Nah, she's my friend.

269
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,366
I'm happy for her.

270
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,909
Well, that's big of you.

271
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,995
Before Phillips, she wasn't
gonna put her name in for chief.

272
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,789
- Didn't think she'd get it.
- Hm.

273
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,333
I always thought she
had a… a real shot.

274
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:58,796
Just couldn't make her believe
in herself. But I guess he could.

275
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,173
She was always his favorite.

276
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,883
- Hm.
- Everybody knew it.

277
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,095
I just wish I'd known what
she was going through.

278
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,014
Yeah, me too.

279
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:22,987
Looks really pale.

280
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,991
Persistently hypotensive
despite fluids and blood.

281
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,452
That explains it. He's got a
lot of blood in his abdomen.

282
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,579
I see it.

283
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,540
He's got a positive FAST.

284
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,168
- What's the situation with the ORs?
- Flooded with traumas.

285
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,629
Telling me at least 20 minutes
until they can take him.

286
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,591
Let's transfuse two units of blood
and set up for a central line.

287
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:44,675
You got it.

288
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,637
He was driving the bus? It's a
hell of a thing to wake up to.

289
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:55,519
I'm sorry.

290
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,230
I, uh…

291
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,565
I wanted to tell you.

292
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:00,691
No, that's okay.

293
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,194
You don't have to talk about it.

294
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,280
And you definitely
don't have to apologize.

295
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,578
What about for getting
the job you wanted?

296
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:14,872
What about that?

297
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,627
Yeah, that I can never forgive.

298
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,548
Come on. It'll be great.

299
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,968
It's not permanent yet.

300
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,512
There's still plenty of
time for me to mess it up.

301
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,726
Danny, it's Cruz. We think her
daughter Vero was on that bus.

302
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,855
- Is she in the ER?
- Not yet, but more are coming in.

303
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,857
- Where's Cruz?
- Scrubbed in on the cyclist.

304
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,318
- Okay, send someone up to tell her.
- No.

305
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,320
- No?
- No, I don't think we should.

306
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:49,049
The chair's daughter might've been
on that bus and you don't think...

307
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,199
And she's in surgery.

308
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:53,535
We'd be distracting her with a
hypothetical while she's operating.

309
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,996
- Danny, I really think...
- I know what you think.

310
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,084
Look, if Vero comes in,

311
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,127
we will tell her then.

312
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:03,754
Okay?

313
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,301
Yeah. Your call.

314
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,853
Hurricane
Abby is making landfall.

315
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:24,358
So those in the city are
encouraged to shelter in place.

316
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,236
However, those residents
along the coastline

317
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:32,157
need to evacuate immediately and
get to a shelter in the city…

318
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,534
First big hurricane?

319
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,162
First one that seems
to be aiming at me.

320
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,124
Growing up here, I've been
through a bunch of these.

321
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,918
Usually it's just the anticipation
that's the worst part.

322
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:47,172
Indiana, it was tornadoes.
Get the warnings all the time.

323
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:50,050
It's when the sky turns green,
then you start worrying.

324
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,972
Well, should we start worrying?

325
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,181
Oh, um…

326
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,184
I don't know. It's hard to say.

327
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,730
But I guess it doesn't look like
we're leaving anytime soon, right?

328
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:03,981
So…

329
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:07,735
Well, I hope you brought your
stuff. Looks like a lot of upkeep.

330
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,610
What do you mean?

331
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,532
Look, it's not that
you don't look great.

332
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:16,368
It's just the…
style around here

333
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,455
is sort of a…
malnourished exhaustion.

334
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,499
So you're saying I stand out?

335
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,583
Kinda.

336
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:24,877
Yeah.

337
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,003
Well, good.

338
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,963
I plan to.

339
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,591
Need a doctor over here!

340
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,778
- Yeah.
- Adult male.

341
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,031
Blunt force trauma to chest,
increased work of breathing.

342
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,848
Trauma bays are
full. Go to room two.

343
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,809
- Uh, Sophie, where's Cole?
- Cole's in with the amputation.

344
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,644
All right. Come
on. You're with me.

345
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,274
BP is 60 and
falling. Pulse ox 75.

346
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,985
- What do his lungs sound like?
- No breath sounds on the left.

347
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,530
- Pulse ox is falling. He's crashing.
- I need to intubate.

348
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,783
I'll deal with his chest
in a minute. Here you go.

349
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,938
- Clear. Suction.
- I got it.

350
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,544
Great.

351
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,008
What is she doing?

352
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,720
- He needs a chest tube.
- And you're doing it? Elijah!

353
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,348
- Hold on. It can wait.
- It can't, and I can do it.

354
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,772
Okay.

355
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,984
Okay, she's doing it.

356
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,530
Guys, we've lost pulses.

357
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,534
Sophie, you need to move faster.

358
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,286
- What's going on?
- I've got it. I'm fine.

359
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,957
We still don't have pulses.
We should start compressions.

360
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,459
- Let me do it.
- You told me to jump in. I got it.

361
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,463
I got it.

362
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,717
She did. Nice save.

363
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,929
Pulses are faint,
but they're back.

364
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,849
- What do we got?
- Tension pneumo.

365
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,351
I decompressed the chest
while Dr. Elijah intubated.

366
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,061
Vitals are stabilizing.

367
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,898
Well, he's not dead, so there's
that. But that chest tube is low.

368
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,943
Let's just pray you didn't
lacerate his spleen.

369
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:14,736
Tom, did you supervise this?

370
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,113
No, I just got here.

371
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:20,242
- Don't know what she was thinking.
- Come on, you told me to jump in.

372
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,703
Tom, just supervise her,
okay? Better, all right?

373
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,580
And call me when the CT's back.

374
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,040
- Cass? Uh…
- Yeah, I got you.

375
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:37,925
What?

376
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:42,472
I mean… you could have been a
little more supportive of Sophie.

377
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,894
Phillips was supportive of
Danny. Look where that got him.

378
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,105
I don't think that was the main issue.

379
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:54,067
Hey, look, um, I just wanted
to say what happened earlier…

380
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,571
Danny getting your job. You
didn't make a scene. That was…

381
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,656
Well…

382
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,658
you're a better man than me.

383
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,125
Let's pack him
up. Get him to CT.

384
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,378
Let's give a gram of TXA and
another two units of blood.

385
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,796
But we're running out of time.

386
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,798
Only thing that'll stop
the bleeding is the OR.

387
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,218
Hey. You're still
working on this guy?

388
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,552
We're still not ready.

389
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,388
Well, so put a junior
resident on him until then.

390
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,724
- He's my patient.
- You're hiding.

391
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,476
- I'm not…
- Luis?

392
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,602
…hiding.

393
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:32,439
- How long has she been in here for?
- No. I don't get involved.

394
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:35,067
You're chief resident
now. You did hear that, right?

395
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,254
You should be out running the floor,
coordinating traumas, helping residents...

396
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,155
Harper. I know.

397
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,741
I know you know.

398
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,202
And I know that you can do it.

399
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:48,330
There's a lot of people out there
that need you to start believing that.

400
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,500
You're ready.

401
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,002
I'm not… I'm not ready.

402
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,879
Only because you refuse to be.

403
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:59,216
It's a festival of gore. How about
I split you open like a turkey,

404
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,551
and you tell me what a
beautiful experience it is?

405
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,137
Know what? I'm gonna say something
you may not have thought of,

406
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,473
and that is that your crippling
fear of pregnant women

407
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,600
might be holding you back
as a medical professional.

408
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,662
- That's ridiculous.
- I've been here nearly a year.

409
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,706
- I've never seen you look one in the eye.
- I'm not afraid of pregnant people.

410
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,074
You're gonna make me
do this, aren't you?

411
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,411
Don't worry. I'll be
right there with you.

412
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,746
Just breathe.

413
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,830
I hate you.

414
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,040
No, you don't.

415
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,628
- Finally. OR's ready.
- BP's coming up.

416
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,297
Danny.

417
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,382
Yeah, okay. Let's
get him moving.

418
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,682
Anchor.

419
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,566
My boys.

420
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,861
Mr. Harris, you were in an accident.
We're gonna take you to surgery.

421
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,195
Is everyone alive?

422
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,115
Huh?

423
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,910
- Did I kill any of my kids?
- We don't know, Mr. Harris.

424
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,997
We are doing everything we can
to get everyone healthy again,

425
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,333
but right now, we need
to get you to the OR.

426
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,709
No, no. No, I'm not going.

427
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:18,295
You are bleeding internally.
You'll die without surgery.

428
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:19,963
No, no, no! No, no.

429
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,924
Look, I'm competent,
okay? I know my rights.

430
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,499
I'm not going anywhere until
I know all my kids are okay.

431
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,521
Okay?

432
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,315
Okay.

433
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,525
Okay.

434
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,405
Oh, hey. You.

435
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,741
Have they heard anything
about that kid Tyler's hand?

436
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:50,243
- Not yet, no.
- They better be looking.

437
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,578
You let me know.

438
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,497
Will do, Cinnabon.

439
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,081
What?

440
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,834
Oh yeah, that's
what they call you.

441
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:01,630
Are you not the hothead surgeon that
thinks unfiltered is a personality?

442
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,217
Has a TikTok called "Surgeon
Bruv"? Ghosts women on Hinge?

443
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,804
- TikTok was a one-time thing.
- Yeah, well, paramedics talk.

444
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:12,599
Turns out I made more friends in my
first week than you have in years.

445
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,104
Hey, why do they
call me Cinnabon?

446
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,527
Take a seat.

447
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,153
We will be right with you.

448
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,951
Hey, Doc. Um, we
were just wondering,

449
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:33,078
is there any update
on Coach Harris?

450
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,621
Can we see him?

451
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:39,084
He's on some pretty heavy sedatives,
but I will keep you updated.

452
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,545
- I promise.
- Can you just tell us what's going on?

453
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,129
You're gonna die without that
surgery. Know that, right?

454
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,866
Was it my fault?

455
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,452
The crash.

456
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,621
The boys don't blame you.

457
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,417
They want to know you'll be
okay. They want to see you.

458
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,253
No, I don't want
them coming in here.

459
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,381
I don't want them knowing
I'm refusing treatment.

460
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:28,633
Don't worry.

461
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:32,429
Without your consent, no one can
interfere with your quiet, stubborn death.

462
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,073
The… The doctor
in the wheelchair,

463
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,868
did you know she's
my younger sister?

464
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:56,702
No.

465
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,204
Really?

466
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:04,794
When we were kids, we
used to… fight, hard.

467
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:09,299
I mean… throwing each other
over tables, ripping out hair.

468
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,850
One day, um… she
was up in my room,

469
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:22,479
and… and she said something
that I didn't like, and…

470
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,608
And I saw the stairs.

471
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,279
"That would be new," I thought.

472
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,699
So I pushed her.

473
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,538
I, um…

474
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,709
I had all of this adrenaline…
and I pushed her so hard that…

475
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:48,547
that she didn't
even hit the stairs.

476
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,508
Just the ground.

477
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,387
And now she lives in a chair.

478
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,771
You want to suffer more than
the people you hurt because

479
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,773
if you do, maybe
they'll forgive you.

480
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,615
How do you suffer?

481
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:19,744
Oh…

482
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,663
I make bad decisions.

483
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,709
I… say shit I shouldn't say.

484
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,214
How's… How's that
working out for you?

485
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,133
Oh, it works great.

486
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,719
Can't do it if
you're dead, though.

487
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,604
Danny!

488
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,565
Dispatch has one more critical
coming in. A minute out.

489
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,749
I heard it could be Vero?

490
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,629
- Do you know what she looks like?
- Yeah.

491
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,089
I can use you, then. Come on.

492
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,388
17-year-old female, blunt
force trauma to the chest.

493
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,642
- BP's crashing, 60 over 40.
- That's her. That's Cruz's daughter.

494
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:26,686
Trauma one is open.

495
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,359
Okay, people, let's help
her. What do we got?

496
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,443
Abdomen's soft.

497
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:36,154
- Lungs are clear. Not protecting airway.
- Pulse thready at 150.

498
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,573
- Intubate her. I'll start her FAST.
- I'll start an IV.

499
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,951
You. Go up to the OR and tell Cruz
her daughter's in the trauma bay.

500
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,578
Prepping intubation.

501
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:44,704
Dr. Cole to…

502
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,749
- Dr. Cole?
- We got all the hands we need, thank you.

503
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,417
Sure you couldn't use one more?

504
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,127
- Looks like a clean cut.
- Danny?

505
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,463
- Go. Kid needs you.
- I'm in. Bag her, please.

506
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:56,383
- BP's crashing.
- Oh shit. Fluid around the heart.

507
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:59,344
Pericardial tamponade. She
needs a pericardiocentesis.

508
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,680
- Luis, call cardiac surgery.
- On it.

509
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:03,515
Push-dose pressors?

510
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,600
We gotta remove the blood
pressing on her heart.

511
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,435
Come on, girlfriend.
Let's get you better.

512
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,312
BP's still
falling. 40 palp.

513
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,480
All right.

514
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,903
Come on. Come on.

515
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,323
Don't go too deep. You don't
want to puncture the heart.

516
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,325
Come on.

517
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,494
I got it.

518
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,082
You got it. BP's coming up.

519
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:32,210
- Where's cardiac surgery?
- Moving at their regular pace, obviously.

520
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:35,088
- My God, did anyone tell them who this is?
- I'll run up there now.

521
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,923
Good thing we bought
some time, huh?

522
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,767
- Oh, Dr. Elijah? Hi.
- Hey.

523
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:51,813
So Dr. Simms told me to tell
Dr. Cruz that her daughter is here,

524
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,648
but I don't know
which OR she's in.

525
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,025
Vero? Vero's here
now? In the ER?

526
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,694
Yeah, she's in the trauma room.

527
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:58,777
All right.

528
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:01,531
- Don't worry, I got it. I'll tell her.
- Okay.

529
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,408
Ready to go.

530
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,037
Are you out of your mind? I'm about
to pop this woman's spleen out.

531
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,124
I'm sorry, but I
had to. It's your daughter.

532
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:13,042
- She's here.
- Here?

533
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,961
She's
downstairs in the ER.

534
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,963
She was on that
bus that crashed.

535
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:20,175
- I'm just hearing about this now?
- She just got in.

536
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,343
Someone had to
have known she was coming.

537
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,181
Did anyone know
she was coming in?

538
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,934
- Answer my question. Did anybody know?
- Danny told us not to tell you.

539
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,147
Call Dr. Harvey. He
needs to replace me.

540
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:35,814
Hurry.

541
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,238
Systolic's in the 70s.

542
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:45,492
- Jesus, where the hell is cardiac surgery?
- Vitals are unstable.

543
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:48,495
- Blood's reaccumulating around the heart.
- Slowly. The vitals are okay.

544
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:51,164
I think we just wait for
surgery. Keep pushing pressors…

545
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:53,917
No, we can't wait.

546
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,168
She needs a drain.

547
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:58,338
Danny, no. No, no, no. Surgery
should be here any minute.

548
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:00,632
- Prep for pericardial drain.
- You got it.

549
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,596
If you go one millimeter too far and
you puncture her heart, she dies.

550
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,557
A drain's risky? Wait until she
crashes and we have to crack her chest.

551
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,683
True, but...

552
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,477
But this is the
chair's daughter.

553
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,937
And you're all scared.

554
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,861
But you know what? I
don't give a shit anymore.

555
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,734
It's the right thing to
do, so I am doing it.

556
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,281
Open the kit.

557
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,141
Almost there.

558
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,355
What the hell?

559
00:30:58,648 --> 00:30:59,732
Lost power!

560
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,484
Backup?

561
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,445
- Cardiac surgery's on their way.
- Backup should be on any second.

562
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,365
Ultrasound's out of battery.
They never charge these things.

563
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,286
I have to keep going.

564
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,913
Wait. With no ultrasound,
she'll be totally blind.

565
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,206
Gabe. She can do it.

566
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,921
It's the rain. Substation
downtown was flooded.

567
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:25,258
Still doesn't explain why our
backup generators haven't kicked on.

568
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,011
Something's wrong.

569
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,534
I've
got a bad feeling.

570
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,765
- What's going on? Stop.
- I can't stop now.

571
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:33,933
Goddamn it, I'll do it.

572
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,143
I got it.

573
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,437
Putting a catheter
over the wire.

574
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,856
It's in position.

575
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,567
- Or it's in the heart.
- Only one way to find out.

576
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,196
About time.

577
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,620
Come on, come on, come on.

578
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,332
Drainage isn't pulsatile.

579
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,293
- BP?
- It's coming up.

580
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:01,753
Vitals are improving.

581
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,546
Good job.

582
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,841
Let's get her upstairs
to the OR. Come on.

583
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,182
Dr. Cruz, I...

584
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,434
When did you know my
daughter was coming in?

585
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,353
When?

586
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:22,065
Um… I knew it was a possibility,
but I wasn't sure until she arrived.

587
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,609
Elijah seemed to be sure.

588
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:27,736
Who else knew?

589
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,824
I told them not to tell you.

590
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,325
You were in surgery. It
wasn't fair to your patient

591
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,289
to upset you with a
hypothetical. It was my call.

592
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,249
- Bullshit, it was your call.
- Vero wasn't here.

593
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,500
- We didn't have confirmation...
- She's my daughter.

594
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,751
How dare you?

595
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,712
There were a dozen people
you could've consulted

596
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,547
before taking her life
into your own hands.

597
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:50,051
You were careless. You were
reckless. You were arrogant.

598
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:53,304
And all you've proved is you have no
understanding of the job I gave you.

599
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:56,182
Yeah, I didn't know it was my job
to know where your daughter was.

600
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:03,815
Sorry.

601
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:17,078

Why do you doubt yourself?

661
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,211
You did a great job
delivering that baby.

662
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,855
- She hated me.
- No, she didn't.

663
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:55,713
She bit me.

664
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:57,340
Only because you were in range.

665
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,385
You're avoiding my question.

666
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,182
- I don't doubt myself.
- You assume the worst will happen.

667
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,142
It usually does.

668
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,061
- You know what I think?
- What?

669
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,689
I think you are so afraid
of your own potential,

670
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,399
you self-sabotage.

671
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,742
Mm.

672
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:28,579
Am I gonna be charged
for this?

673
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:29,747
Yes.

674
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,375
What are you doing?

675
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,252
- Danny, I…
- No.

676
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,259
I tried calling you.

677
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:42,969
A few times.

678
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,347
I saw.

679
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,017
- We could've just talked.
- I didn't want to talk.

680
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,061
All right. So you blew
up our lives instead?

681
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,063
You dropped a nuke on
me to prove a point?

682
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,774
This… is why I
didn't want to talk.

683
00:37:56,857 --> 00:38:00,403
If you had just trusted me, none
of this would have happened.

684
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:03,906
Yeah, it happened
because I did trust you.

685
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,827
- I meant everything I ever said to you.
- No.

686
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,872
You told me what I wanted to hear,
and I was dumb enough to believe it.

687
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:15,501
Says the person who just lied to a
patient to get him to go to surgery.

688
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,254
Uh-huh, I heard what
you said to that coach.

689
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:21,590
You didn't push Harper down
the stairs. Your dad did.

690
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,181
I saved his life.

691
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,767
Yeah, and you still lied.

692
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,980
I know what happened
at your old hospital.

693
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:42,153
I found out the real reason you
got transferred from Kennedy.

694
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:43,946
That's why you're doing this?

695
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:48,326
- What is it you think you know?
- Dr. Phillips, Dr. Simms.

696
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:51,370
This storm, it's
gonna be a direct hit.

697
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:55,082
And we're gonna ride it out…
but we are understaffed.

698
00:38:56,876 --> 00:39:00,004
This is not a referendum
on your competence,

699
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,256
or your ability to
be a good chief.

700
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,052
And the hospital is taking
your claim extremely seriously.

701
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,930
But we are about to
be in a world of shit.

702
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,518
I think it would be to everyone's
benefit that Dr. Phillips stays to help.

703
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,023
Do you agree, Dr. Simms?

704
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:23,443
Hm.

705
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,112
Good.

706
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,323
I need you both out there. Now.

707
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:31,160
